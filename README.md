**Description:**  
This is a placeholder repository for API usage.  

My private Discord bot uses this API solely for an internal feature: sending **one random NFT from a chosen collection** every morning at 8:00 AM on my server.  

**Notes:**  
- This bot is **strictly private** and not intended for public use.  
- No code is exposed here for security and privacy reasons.  
- The API is only used to fetch NFT images and information (name/number and the NFT creator) to post them on Discord in a private server.  
- **No NFTs will ever be resold or redistributed.**  
- Usage of this API fully complies with the providerâ€™s Terms of Service and Developer Terms, and I acknowledge that I have read and understood all relevant conditions.  

**License:**  
For private use only.
